# PSX Stock Movement Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **next-day stock movement (Up/Down)** for Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) stocks using classical machine learning models. It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation. The goal is to provide a reliable classification framework for investors and analysts.
